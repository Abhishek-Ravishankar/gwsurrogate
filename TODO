Some features to add

1) file for relevant fit info, would include affine_map boolean, string specifying which functions fit coefficients are to be associated with (or user defined ones), and calling functions from rompy

2) how to best impliment surrogate-specific fits? from python file? string interpreted symbolically?

3) add more meta-data to setup.py

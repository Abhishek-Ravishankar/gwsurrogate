Welcome to gwsurrogate!
-----------------------

gwsurrogate is an easy interface to gravitational wave surrogate models.

Surrogates provide a fast and accurate evaluation mechanism for gravitational
waveforms which would otherwise be found through solving differential 
equations. These equations must be solved in the ``building" phase, which 
was performed using other codes. For details see:

``Fast prediction and evaluation of gravitational waveforms using surrogate 
models”, arXiv: gr-qc:1308.3565

If you find this package useful in your work, please cite reference [1] and, 
if available, the relevant paper describing the specific surrogate used.

Installation
------------

gwsurrogate is a pure-Python module, thus installation is very easy. 

From pip: 

The python package pip supports installing from PyPI (the Python Package 
Index). gwsurrogate can be installed to the standard location 
(e.g. /usr/local/lib/pythonX.X/dist-packages) with

>>> pip install gwsurrogate

From source: 

Download and unpack gwsurrogate-X.X.tar.gz to any folder gws_folder of your 
choosing. The gwsurrogate module can be used immediately by adding

  import sys
  sys.path.append('absolute_path_to_gws_folder')

at the beginning of any script/notebook which uses gwsurrogate. 

Alternatively, if you are a bash or sh user, edit your .profile 
(or .bash_profile) file and add the line

  export PYTHONPATH=~absolute_path_to_gws_folder:$PYTHONPATH

For a "proper" installation into gws_folder run

>>> python setup.py install --prefix=absolute_path_to_gws_folder

and edit the PYTHONPATH environment variable as described above.


Getting Started
---------------

Please read the gwsurrogate docstring found in the __init__.py file
or from ipython with

>>> import gwsurrogate as gw
>>> gw?

(Additional examples for text and hdf5 based surrogates can be 
found in the accompanying ipython notebooks.)


Planned Development
-------------------

-- Surrogate-specific parametric fitting functions. 

-- Better interface with rompy

-- More meta-data to setup.py

-- Mutli-mode surrogates with summations over tensor spherical harmonics

-- Amplitude and phase surrogates of the kind described in (CITE MICHAEL AND BLACKMAN)

-- More descriptive surrogate names: EOBNRv2_q1to2_sA_0to0_0to0_0to0_sB_0to0_0to0_0to0_SingleModes

-- Mult-mode surrogates defined on a common temporal grid (text-based ones build mode-by-mode, and each mode could possibly have a different length depending on the alignment.

-- adherence to pep standards

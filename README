Welcome to gwsurrogate!
-----------------------

gwsurrogate is an easy interface to gravitational wave surrogate models.

Surrogates provide a fast and accurate evaluation mechanism for gravitational
waveforms which would otherwise be found through solving differential 
equations. These equations must be solved in the ``building" phase, which 
was performed using other codes. For details on surrogate building see:

Getting Started
---------------

1) load ipython
2) import the surrogate model 'import gwsurrogate as gw'
3) view docstring instructions 'gw?'

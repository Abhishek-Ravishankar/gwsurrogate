Welcome to gwsurrogate!
-----------------------

gwsurrogate is an easy interface to gravitational wave surrogate models.

Surrogates provide a fast and accurate evaluation mechanism for gravitational
waveforms which would otherwise be found through solving differential 
equations. These equations must be solved in the ``building" phase, which 
was performed using other codes. For details on surrogate building see

Scott Field, Chad Galley, Jan Hesthaven, Jason Kaye, and Manuel Tiglio.

1) run ipython from the command line 

2) import the routines with "from EvaluateSurrogate import *"

3) Create instance of surrogate class. Must pass location of data files upon initialization, e.g. "EOB = SurrogateEOB('SurrogateQ1to2/')"

4) Generate EOB waveforms by specifying a q value, e.g "times, hp, hc = EOB(1.2)"

5) Directly plot the same EOB waveform with "EOB.Generate(q_eval=1.2)"

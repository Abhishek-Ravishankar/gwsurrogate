Surrogate data formats and gwsurrogate functions
================================================

1) Folder name to instantiate Surrogate class:

MODELNAME__qQMIN_QMAX__NoSpin__lenLEN__MultiMode/SingleMode

(MODELNAME = "EOBNRv2", for example)

2) metadata.txt (contains everything describing the surrogate and its generation, mention reference interval for fitting,...)

3) HDF5/TXT contents: (h+ - i hx = Ae^{-i phi}
	SurrogateID (string, repeat parent directory name)
	B (complex matrix, basis-by-times)
	eim_indices (array of integers, labeled from 0)
	greedy_points (ordered by their selection)
	dt
	tmin
	qmin_fit, qmax_fit (range used for fitting)
	affine_map = True, False (Boolean; whether affine map to reference interval was used; use as flag for evaluating fits)
	fit_params (phi, A; coefficients of fitting functions; eim_indices-by-coefficients)
	V (not its inverse; to reconstruct the rb.basis, E = B V)
	R (matrix of coefficients relating basis and waveforms, H = E R)

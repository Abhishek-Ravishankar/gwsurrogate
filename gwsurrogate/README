Surrogate data formats and gwsurrogate functions
================================================

1) Folder name to instantiate Surrogate class:

MODELNAME_q[QMIN]_[QMAX]_NoSpin_[Multi(Single)]Mode/l[ELL]_m[M]_len[TIME]M_SurID[RBDIM]poly

(MODELNAME = "EOBNRv2", for example) and quantities in [] are determined by the surrogate settings

2) metadata.txt (contains everything describing the surrogate and its generation, mention reference interval for fitting,...)

3) HDF5/TXT contents: (h+ - i hx = Ae^{-i phi}
	SurrogateID (string, repeat parent directory name)
	B (complex matrix, basis-by-times)
	eim_indices (array of integers, labeled from 0)
	greedy_points (ordered by their selection)
	tmin, tmax, dt. (Text surrogates store these in time_info.txt)
	qmin_fit, qmax_fit (range used for fitting).
	affine_map = True, False (Boolean; whether affine map to reference interval was used; use as flag for evaluating fits)
	fit_coeff_amp 
	fit_coeff_phase (coefficients of fitting functions; eim_indices-by-coefficients)
	V (not its inverse; to reconstruct the rb.basis, E = B V)
	R (matrix of coefficients relating basis and waveforms, H = E R)
	

Text-based surrogates
=====================

All text-based surrogates should come as .tar.gz. To create new ones use

tar -cvzf SURROGATE_NAME.tar.gz SURROGATE_NAME/	

which can be extracted with

tar -xvzf SURROGATE_NAME.tar.gz

Overview
========
Surrogates produced from EOBNRv2 model as implimented in the 
LIGO Analysis Library (LAL) Suite version 
'git hash 59c12886b026c863397f191e6c2ca69ef3498616' with 
'sSub = 0'. 

Surrogate model waveforms are all peak aligned on a finely
sampled temporal grid, with the beginning portions of 
longer waveforms cut off so as to make all waveforms of equal
length. 

Additional information can be found in specific surrogate
directories.
